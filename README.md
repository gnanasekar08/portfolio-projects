## Portfolio-projects

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find some of the projects I've been working on.



## Project 1: [User Data Analytics](https://github.com/gnanasekar08/User-Activity-Analysis---SQL-)
In this case study, we analyze user activity data to derive insights and trends. The goal is to understand user behaviour patterns. Analysing session trends and monitoring login activities are crucial for strategic planning and improving overall user engagement. This analysis can help in enhancing user engagement and improving service offerings.

## Project 2: [Retail Order Analysis](https://github.com/gnanasekar08/Retail-Order-Data-Analysis)
In this project, I completed an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python and SQL. I started by downloading the dataset using the Kaggle API, then proceeded with data processing and cleaning using Pandas. Afterward, I loaded the data into a SQL server and used SQL to answer some interesting questions.
